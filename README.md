MATLAB code accompanying the Modeling Abnormal Beliefs tutorial
===============
This code runs on MATLAB R2020a.

Getting Started
---------------
1.  Please, clone this repository recursively. Otherwise, you will not have all the necessary toolboxes to run the code. You can do so using the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Murdugan/Tutorial-Code-Modelling-Abnormal-Beliefs.git
```
2. Open Matlab and navigate to the kcni-school-lessons/day6 folder.
3. Set your environment by running `'kcni_setup_paths'`

Tutorial: Modeling Abnormal Beliefs
------------
1. Set your environment using `'kcni_setup_paths'`
2. Part 1: First steps with the HGF: Run `'HGF_tutorial_generate_task'` section by section (you can do so by clicking in the corresponding section of the script and clicking the 'Run and Advance' Button at the top of the Matlab window next to the green triangle labelled 'Run').
3. Part 2: Simulating prototypical patients: Run `'HGF_tutorial_generate_learners'` section by section


Assignments
------------
1. Use the HGF tutorial code to generate a specific subtype of a clinical condition that you would like to model (for example, MDD or Schizophrenia) reflecting.

	a. What clinical condition do you want to simulate?
	
	b. What parameters could you change to simulate belief trajectories corresponding to this condition?
	
	c. Could you obtain similar belief trajectories using a different set of parameters?
