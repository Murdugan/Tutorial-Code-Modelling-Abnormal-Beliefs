%mmn_REMOVE_FIRST_EEG_TRIAL Removes the first trial of a preprocessed, epoched EEG data set from
%the mmn study. 
%   This function checks whether the first trial has already been marked as bad by the artefact
%   rejection routines from the preprocessing step. If not, it marks the first trial as bad, such
%   that it won't be included in the statistics which will run on the images after conversion. This
%   is an important step in the modelbased analysis, as the model only defines PEs for observed
%   transitions, and the first transition is only observed as the presentation of the second tone.
